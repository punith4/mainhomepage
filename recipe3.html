            <p> Tomatoes. Ripe tomatoes are always best but canned whole tomatoes will also be delicious.
                Balsamic vinegar. 
                Olive oil. 
                Salt, pepper and sugar. 
                Onion. 
                Garlic. 
                Basil leaves. Other herbs like thyme and oregano are also delicious with tomatoes.
                Stock. Use any stock or broth of your choice. I used chicken broth but vegetable stock can be used if you want to keep this recipe vegetarian.
                Tomato paste.
                Cream. Heavy cream/whipping cream.

                Making:Preheat the oven to 200°C/390°F.
                Place the tomatoes (if using canned tomatoes, add all the juices as well) in a roasting tray and add the Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, sugar and salt. Stir to combine and place in the oven for 25-30 minutes until the tomatoes are broken down and have started to caramelize.
                In a large pot, sauté the onions in some olive oil until they are translucent and fragrant. Add the garlic and basil and fry for another minute.
                Add the roasted tomatoes, tomato paste and sugar. Stir to combine all the ingredients and pour in the stock.
                Lower the heat and cover the pot. Allow to simmer for 10 minutes.
                Remove the pot from the heat and blend the soup.
                Add the cream and season to taste.
                To make the grilled cheese sandwiches, mix the mozzarella with the cheddar. Add ½ cup cheese to half of the slices of bread. Sandwich with the remaining bread. Butter both sides generously.
                Cook in a non-stick pan, over medium heat until the cheese is melted and the sandwiches are golden brown on both sides.
                Serve the tomato soup with a swirl of cream and fresh basil leaves with the grilled cheese sandwiches.
